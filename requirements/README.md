# Requirements Gathering

## Methods

Two methods were used for requirements gathering:
- Questionnaire survey **(n=20)**
  * We felt that a survey would be the easiest way for us to get quantatative data
- 1-on-1 Interviews **(n=2)**
  * Originally, we wanted to do focus groups, but due to scheduling and time constraints, we opted for a 1-on-1 interview using the questions we developed for the focus group. This method would help us get qualitative data

## Findings

### Questionnaire
Our main method of sharing the survey was sending to fellow classmates / friends. We didn't add in demographic questions in our survey, so we can only assume what the questionnaire demographic consists of, which might be mainly male students in their early 20s.

Here are the distributions for our survey questions:
* More than half agreed that they would use a plant app
* 90% of respondents say they would find an app that provided information on plants useful
* 50% of our respondents find themselves looking for information on plants
* Information the users stated they look for in plants are: 
  - How to take care of a plant
  - Species of a plant
  - Benefits of a plant
* 75% of respondents would be open to having a portfolio for their plants
* 55% of respondents expressed that they would like to meet others with similar plant interests
* 50% of respondents expressed some interest in exchanging plant information with others
* 75% of respondents reported that previous experience in finding information on plants was not satisfactory
* 75% of respondents reported that their knowledge of plants is average or below average
* 75% of respondents reported that they donâ€™t see themselves as a plant enthusiast 

### 1-on-1 Interviews
We interviewed two people, both who are majoring in the life science field (Biochemistry / Biology). They both are in their early 20s, one female and the other male.

* Both found no app that makes it easy to obtain plants
* Both found that the idea of Plant Social would be a great social idea for plant enthusiasts
* One of the interviewees found pot sizing a problem when obtaining plants
* Both found an app to be  more accessible rather than having to look everything up from different sources

## Conclusions
We can conclude that there is a big need for a social app for plant enthusiasts based on the results from both our questionnaire survey and interviews.
Based on our 1-on-1 interviews, we see that there is a need for an "all-in-one" plant application for plant enthusiasts. Furthermore, one of our interviewees expressing their frustration for being unable to find certain sizes of pots expresses the need for a plant-based buy/sell/trade feature for our project. Despite 75% of respondents not labelling themselves as plant enthusiasts, the 90% finding an app for plant info useful tells us that people with non-plant interests could be introduced to plants, like "dipping their feet" in the hobby. 

## Caveats
It was harder than we expected to get responses to our survey. Due to our lack of demographic information for our questionnaire survey, we don't have clear information as to who answered our survey. Our assumed demographic for the questionnaire might not be what we were aiming for as we saw that 75% of respondents don't see themselves as a plant enthusiast, so there is a chance we might have to reformat the survey and try again with our aimed demographic of plant enthusiasts.
