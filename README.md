# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

## Executive Summary

The project's goal is to create an app to provide information to users about plants including information on how to care for a plant. 
The app will also provide a platform for users to interact with other users about sharing information on plants and to provide a service 
to exchange or give their plants to other users.

We asked other students, family, and friends to take a questionnaire (n=20).
* More than half agreed that they would use a plant app
* 90% of respondents say they would find an app that provided information on plants useful
* 50% of our respondents find themselves looking for information on plants
* Information the users stated they look for in plants are: 
  
  How to take care of a plant
  
  Species of a plant
  
  Benefits of a plant

* 75% of respondents would be open to having a portfolio for their plants
* 55% of respondents expressed that they would like to meet others with similar plant interests
* 50% of respondents expressed some interest in exchanging plant information with others
* 75% of respondents reported that previous experience in finding information on plants was not satisfactory
* 75% of respondents reported that their knowledge of plants is average or below average
* 75% of respondents reported that they donâ€™t see themselves as a plant enthusiast 

We interviewed people who are in the life science field
* Number of people who participated in the one on one interview: 2
* Both in the life science field 

* 100% found no app that makes it easy to obtain plants
* 100% found it would be a great social idea for plant enthusiasts
* 50% found pot sizing a problem when obtaining plants
* 100% found an app to be useful as it would be much more accessible rather than having to look everything up from different sources 

From our requirements gathering, we have identified that:

* Being provided information on how to take care of a plant would be the most important thing provided by a plant-based app as well as being given general information on plants.
* Users interested in plants would be open to being able to interact with other users about plants.
