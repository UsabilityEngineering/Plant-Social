# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

## Executive Summary

The project's goal is to create an app to provide information to users about plants including information on how to care for a plant. 
The app will also provide a platform for users to interact with other users about sharing information on plants and to provide a service 
to exchange or give their plants to other users.

We used two methods for our requirements gathering:
- Questionnaire
- 1-on-1 Interviews

### Questionnaire (n=20)
* Information the users stated they look for in plants are: 
  - How to take care of a plant
  - Species of a plant
  - Benefits of a plant
* <ins>**More than half agreed**</ins> that they would use a plant app
* 90% of respondents say they would find an app that provided information on plants useful
* 50% of our respondents find themselves looking for information on plants
* 55% of respondents expressed that they would like to meet others with similar plant interests
* 75% of respondents reported that previous experience in <ins>**finding information on plants was not satisfactory**</ins>

### 1-on-1 Interviews (n=2)
* Both of our interviewees are majoring in the life science field

* Both found that there is no app that makes it easy to obtain plants
* Both found it would be a <ins>**great social idea for plant enthusiasts**</ins>
* Both found an app to be useful as it would be <ins>**much more accessible**</ins> rather than having to look everything up from different sources 

From our requirements gathering, we have identified that:
* <ins>**Plant care information is considered the most important thing**</ins> for a plant-based app.
* Users interested in plants would be <ins>**open to being able to interact with other users**</ins> about plants.
