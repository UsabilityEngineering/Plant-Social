# Requirements Gathering

## Summary of Formative Feedback/Findings

We asked our participants (n=5) to complete a total of 4 tasks relating to retreiving info on plants, post creation, and messaging. We asked our participants to think aloud so we could observe their thought processes and behaviours while navigating our app's interface.

From our heuristic evaluation, we found that the UI of our app had **consistency**, **freedom**, and **flexibility**. We noted that the general layout of our interface is solid and it was understandable to the user due to conventions placed by other social-type apps. From the critiques, we noted that there was a discrepancy in how our top search bar would take you somewhere different than the bottom search button and our general app **aesthetic** was clunky. These notes helped us in our revision of our prototype.

From our cognitive walkthrough, a participant took on the role of **Kayla** from the scenarios that we provided. As Kayla, the confusing flow of our search feature became more prominent, as the participant was confused on the layout of the search buttons and where they took you. This solidified our need to re-work how we did our search.

## Tasks

### Task 1

We asked participants to assume the role of someone who just got a plant, but they don't know the name of it. Their task was to use the app to search for information on the unknown plant. This task would show us the difficulty of searching for a plant with no name. Our expected goal for the user would be to end up using the camera feature to identify the plant.
